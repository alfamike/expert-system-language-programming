Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients such as Energy Protein and Essential Amino acids Vitamin A Vitamin D several B vitamins including B12 Pantothenic and Folic acids and essential minerals such as Calcium Magnesium Phosphorus Potassium Zinc as well as other minerals Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?  Most milk in the world about 85% is produced from cattle However water buffaloes goats sheep and camel are also dairy animals The United States India the European Union Brazil and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people Globally around 150 million small-scale dairy households equivalent to 750 million people are engaged in milk production The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries but in India alone there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014 This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow reaching 22260 lb (over 10100 kg) per lactation in 2014 How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population  In this MOOOOO-C you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally  Course lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week The Dairy MOOC team thanks Dr Antonio Branco (Universidade Estadual de Maring� Brazil) and Ms Yuanyuan Zhang (Pennsylvania State University) for translating the lecture materials  Course Sponsors  This course was supported by the generous contributions of Innovation Center for US Dairy at Silver Level and Pancosma North America RP Nutrients Inc and Arm and Hammer which provided funding support at a Bronze Level  The Pennsylvania State University has final responsibility for the academic content of this course'), nl,

This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat  In the first half of the course we investigate DNA replication and ask the question where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome  In the second half of the course we examine a different biological question when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA  Perhaps surprisingly we will apply randomized algorithms which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems  Finally you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go "dormant" within a host for many years before causing an active infection'), nl,

Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics  In this course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations  One of the main `consumers� of Combinatorics is Probability Theory This area is connected with numerous sides of life on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop  In the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game  As prerequisites we assume only basic math (eg we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions) basic programming in python (functions loops recursion) common sense and curiosity Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT starting from motivated high school students  Do you have technical problems?

But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system the impact of software failures can be huge even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives Software and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems is very complex and very difficult to get right However we _need_ dependability in the systems we use directly or indirectly to support us in our everyday lives  System Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors   This first course �Automata and behavioural equivalences\' builds the foundation of the subsequent courses showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal The answer to this question is not at all straightforward but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely Especially in the combination with hiding of behaviour equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems far more effective than simulation or testing Using this insight we can make the models correct Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise reliable and maintainable software  This course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation System Validation as a set of courses is part of a larger EIT Digital online programme called \'Internet of Things through Embedded Systems\''), nl,
